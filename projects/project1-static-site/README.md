# Project 1: Static Website Hosting on S3 with Route 53 & CloudFront

## Overview
Hosted my AWS journey site at [gmmguerra.com](https://gmmguerra.com). Used S3 for storage, CloudFront for CDN, and Route 53 for DNS.

## Key AWS Services
- S3: Static hosting with private bucket and OAC.
- CloudFront: Global caching and HTTPS.
- Route 53: Domain routing.

## Improvements
- Updated to private S3 with restricted policy for security.
- Added error handling.

## Screenshots
(We'll add these next.)

## Code/Config
- Bucket Policy: [bucket-policy.json](bucket-policy.json)
